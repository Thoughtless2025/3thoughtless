# Debugging Summary v2: New Project

## Project Goal & Architecture

(The overall goal and architecture remain the same as the original summary.)

- **Goal:** Create a Gemini adapter with a separate Google OAuth flow.
- **Architecture:** Frontend -> Middleware (Firebase Functions) -> Adapters.

## New Project Setup (`athoughtless`)

To rule out environment issues, we started a new Firebase project from scratch (`athoughtless`).

- A new local git repository was initialized.
- `firebase init` was run to set up **Cloud Functions** (TypeScript) and **Firebase Hosting**.
- The project was successfully linked to a billing account (the "Blaze" plan) after resolving a project quota limit by unlinking older projects.

## The Deployment Sagas

Achieving a successful deployment required overcoming multiple layers of issues.

### Part 1: Build-Time Errors (Linting & TypeScript)

The initial code templates and early versions of the OAuth code failed to deploy due to strict pre-deploy checks.

- **Initial Errors:** The default `index.ts` template had unused variables, which caused the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to fail the build.
- **Linting Style Errors:** After fixing the initial errors, multiple deployments failed due to ESLint rules regarding code style (indentation, quote style, line length, missing trailing newlines). These were fixed by running `eslint --fix` and manually refactoring.
- **TypeScript Logic Errors:** A `not all code paths return a value` error was caught by the compiler and fixed by adding explicit `return` statements.

### Part 2: Runtime & Configuration Errors

Once the code passed the build checks, it failed to start up correctly in the cloud.

- **`Container Healthcheck Failed`:** The deployed function would not start. We used `firebase functions:log` to inspect the logs.
- **`functions.config()` Deprecation:** The logs revealed the root cause: `functions.config()` is a v1 method and is not available in Cloud Functions v2. The function was crashing on startup.
- **Secrets Management:** The fix was to switch to the modern v2 method for secrets:
    1. We used `firebase functions:secrets:set` to store the OAuth credentials in Google Secret Manager.
    2. We updated the function code to use `setGlobalOptions({ secrets: [...] })` to grant the function access to these secrets at runtime via `process.env`.

## The Hosting Rewrite Failure

After achieving a successful deployment, we discovered a fundamental issue with Firebase Hosting for this project.

- **Symptom:** Requests to the hosting URL (e.g., `https://athoughtless.web.app/api/hello`) consistently failed with a `Cannot GET` error.
- **Diagnosis:** This proved that the `rewrite` rules in `firebase.json` were not being honored by the hosting service, despite being configured correctly in multiple ways.
- **Resolution:** We abandoned the hosting rewrite approach and switched to using the **direct function URL** (`https://us-central1-athoughtless.cloudfunctions.net/api`) for all requests. This workaround was successful and proved the function itself was working.

## Current Status & Blockers

- The OAuth flow is fully implemented in the `api` function.
- The frontend `index.html` page correctly links to the direct function URLs.
- **Current Blocker:** When testing the OAuth flow, Google's server returns an `Error 401: invalid_client`. This means it does not recognize the OAuth Client ID we are using.
- **Hypothesis:** Since we have confirmed the correct ID is being used, this is almost certainly a **propagation delay** on Google's side, or the credential itself was created in a bad state.

## Next Steps

The user is considering two options to resolve the `invalid_client` error:

1.  **Wait:** Pause for a significant amount of time (e.g., an hour or more) to see if the propagation delay resolves itself.
2.  **Re-create Credentials:** Delete the existing OAuth Client ID in the Google Cloud Console and create a new one from scratch.

The user has also decided to **relax the ESLint style rules** to prevent further deployment friction, while keeping the more useful bug-finding rules active.
